# gMA3-SysMon-Logger
A System Monitor logger for gMA3 that runs on Windows.

The script create a `gMA3Logs` directory on the Desktop.
The log files use this naming convention:
```
SysMon_<date>_<month>_<year>_<hour>_<minute>_<second>.txt
```
In the next versions, it is the idea to store log files in their respective date directories.
